                    <p>The CERBERUS weapons program was initiated in tandem with the TARTARUS Initiative following the end of WWII. Its primary focus and function was
                    towards the development of weapons capable of driving low-impact kinetic operations around the globe. <br>This section covers the details of the program
                    such as history, etymologies, and other related materials.</p>

                    <h3>WWII</h3>
                        <p>After the success of Eisenhower's campaign in Europe, all that was left was to clean up in the Pacific. However, it proved a much more difficult
                        task as the daring and daunting nature of the Japanese forces had a major impact on casualties on the Allied front. Prior to the Project Manhattan,
                        Project X-Ray sought the help of bats rigged with timed incendiaries to topple Japanese industrial infrastructure. While the project was never
                        fully executed, it proved to be the direct inspiration for CERBERUS after the war.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Vietnam | SK-Project</h3>
                        <p>X-Ray, Project Pidgeon (later renamed Project Orcon), and even the British Special Operations Executive's appropriately named "Rat Bomb" were
                        the basis of CERBERUS's orientation to use animals to aide in warfare. One of the first projects to take flight was known as the SK-Project, named
                        after its two founders Sebastian Mullens and Aaron Kieves. The SK-Project was inspired by Sebastian when, on his farm, he observed a rabbit hopping
                        out of and back into a burrow when his dog had freightened it. With the assistance of Aaron Kieves, he developed a bomb vest for a rabbit that would,
                        in theory, assist the US forces in the Vietnam conflict. <br>Introducing the invasive Oryctolagus Cuniculus of the Lagomorpha Leporidae family,
                        colloquially known as the European rabbit, into Vietnam would lead to a massive disruption in enemy logistics and morale as detailed in the original
                        project pitch to President Kennedy's advisory staff. The rabbits would dismantle enemy logistics at multiple echeleons- at the surface level, they
                        would consume needed food and rations out in the open, as was anticipated of Vietcong sanitary behavior. Many would also seek shelter in the  VC caves
                        and expansive tunnel systems dug throughout the country. With the SK-vest, as the duo had come to call the device, the explosives would be triggered
                        by a relay of a specific combination of frequencies generated by passing choppers that would also be playing demoralizing sounds such as the spirits
                        of the Vietnamese and loud music. The project was taken and executed some time into the conflict but dismantled following the fall of Saigon when an SK
                        vest had destroyed a US helicopter that was evacuating, on top of other similar reports that had left Vietnam.
